"""
The Fix-it Shop has just received three new repair projects that must be repaired quickly
1.A radio
2.A toaster oven
3.A coffee table

Three workers with different talents are able to do the jobs
Owner estimates wage cost for workers on projects
Objective â€“minimize total cost

Let
Xij = 1 if person i is assigned to task j, 0 otherwise

where
i=1, 2, 3, with 1 = Adams, 2 = Brown, and 3 = Cooper

Minimize total cost = 11X11 + 14X12 + 6X13 + 8X21
