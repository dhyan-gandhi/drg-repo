8-18.	

    X1	= number of medical patients

Maximize revenue = $2,280X1 + $1,515X2

subject to

	8X1 +  5X2	  <= 32,850 (patient-days available = 365 days ï‚´ 90 new beds)
    3.1X1 + 2.6X2 <= 15,000 (lab tests)
	1X1 +   2X2	  <= 7,000 (x-rays)
	X2	          <= 2,800 (operations/surgeries)
	X1, X2	>= 0

solution:
    
	X1	= 2,791 medical patients
	X2	= 2,105 surgical patients
	revenue	= $9,551,659 per year 
To convert X1 and X2 to number of medical versus surgical beds, find the total number of hospital days for each type of patient:
	medical	= (2,791 patients)(8 days/patient)
		= 22,328 days
	surgical	= (2,105 patients)(5 days/patient)
		= 10,525 days
	total	= 32,853 days (The rounding causes this to be slightly higher than the limit.)
This represents 68% medical days and 32% surgical days, which yields 61 medical beds and 29 surgical beds.
